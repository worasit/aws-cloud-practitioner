# What is Cloud Computing?

Cloud computing is the on-demand delivery of compute, database, storage, applications, and other IT resources through a
cloud services platform via the internet with `pay-as-you-go` pricing.

Think of it as simply renting someone else computers!

# The 6 Advantages of Cloud Computing

## 1) - Trade Capital Expense(CAPEX) for Variable Expense(OPEX)

Instead of having to invest heavily in data centers and servers before you know how you are going to use them, you can
pay only when you consume computing resources, and pay only for how much you consume.

## 2) - Benefit from Massive Economies of Scale

You will never have the same purchasing power as Amazon. They literally build their own servers!

## 3) - Stop Guessing about Capacity

You will probably either buy too much or too little. If you buy too much, you have wasted money and if you buy too
little you will have downtime. Cloud can scale with your business needs, with no long term contracts.

## 4) - Increase speed and agility

The A Cloud Guru platform was built in 3 weeks, using a new type of design called serverless architecture. It scales
infinitely with demand. 15 years ago we would have had to buy servers and rent data centre space, and we probably never
would have got off the ground.

## 5) - Stop spending money running and maintaining data centers

Focus on what you are good at, not at managing infrastructure. Let someone else manage that for you.

## 6) - Go global in a minutes

Easily deploy your application in multiple regions around the world with just a few clicks. This means you can provide
lower latency and a better experience for your customers at minimal cost.
